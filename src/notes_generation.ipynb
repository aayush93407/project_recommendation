      "• Thumb encodes a subset of the 32-bit ARM instructions into a 16-bit \n",
      "instruction set space.\n",
      "• Thumb has higher code density—the space taken up in memory by an \n",
      "executable program—than ARM.\n",
      "• For memory-constrained embedded systems, for example, mobile\n",
      "   phones and PDAs, code density is very important.\n",
      "• On average, a Thumb implementation of the same code takes up \n",
      "around 30% less memory than the equivalent ARM implementation.\n",
      "• Each Thumb instruction is related to a 32-bit ARM instruction.\n",

      "\fTHUMB register usage\n",
      "\n",
      "\fARM-Thumb Interworking\n",
      "\n",
      "• ARM-Thumb interworking is the name given to the method of linking \n",
      "ARM and Thumb code together for both assembly and C/C++.\n",
      "• ATPCS defines the ARM and Thumb procedure call standards.\n",
      "• To call a Thumb routine from an ARM routine, the core has to change \n",
      "state.\n",
      "• This state change is shown in the T bit of the cpsr.\n",
      "• The BX and BLX branch instructions cause a switch between ARM and \n",
      "Thumb state while branching to a routine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\fOther Branch Instructions\n",
      "\n",
      "• There are two variations of the standard branch instruction, or B.\n",

      "instruction in Thumb state.\n",
      "\n",
      "\fData Processing Instructions\n",
      "\n",
      "• The data processing instructions manipulate data within registers.\n",
      "• They include move instructions, arithmetic instructions, shifts, logical \n",
      "instructions, comparison instructions, and multiply instructions.\n",
      "• The Thumb data processing instructions are a subset of the ARM data \n",
      "processing instructions.\n",
      "• These instructions follow the same style as the equivalent ARM \n",
      "instructions.\n",
      "• Most Thumb data processing instructions operate on low registers \n",

      "\n",

      "• They only support the increment after (IA) addressing mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "\fStack Instructions\n",
      "\n",
      "• The Thumb stack operations are different from the equivalent ARM \n",
      "instructions because they use the more traditional POP and PUSH \n",
      "concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The interesting point to note is that there is no stack pointer in the \n",
      "instruction. This is because the stack pointer is fixed as register r13 in \n",
      "Thumb operations and sp is automatically updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\fSoftware Interrupt Instruction\n",
      "\n",
      "• Similar to the ARM equivalent, the Thumb software interrupt (SWI) \n",
      "instruction causes a software interrupt exception.\n",
      "• If any interrupt or exception flag is raised in Thumb state, the \n",
      "processor automatically reverts back to ARM state to handle the \n",
      "exception.\n",
      "• The Thumb SWI instruction has the same effect and nearly the same \n",
      "syntax as the ARM equivalent.\n",
      "• It differs in that the SWI number is limited to the range 0 to 255 and it \n",
      "is not conditionally executed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\fSummary\n",
      "\n",
      "• All Thumb instructions are 16 bits in length.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Thumb provides approximately 30% better code density over ARM code.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Most code written for Thumb is in a high-level language such as C and C++.\n",
      "\n",
      "• ATPCS defines how ARM and Thumb code call each other, called ARM-Thumb interworking.\n",
      "\n",
      "• In Thumb, only the branch instructions are conditionally executed. The barrel shift operations \n",
      "\n",
      "(ASR, LSL, LSR, and ROR) are separate instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The multiple-register load-store instructions only support the increment after (IA) addressing \n",
      "\n",
      "mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The Thumb instruction set includes POP and PUSH instructions as stack operations. These \n",
      "\n",
      "instructions only support a full descending stack.\n",
      "\n",
      "• There are no Thumb instructions to access the coprocessors, cpsr, and spsr.\n",

      "• It’s only worth optimizing functions that are frequently executed and \n",
      "important for performance.\n",
      "• C compilers have to translate your C function literally into assembler \n",
      "so that it works for all possible inputs.\n",
      "• In practice, many of the input combinations are not possible or won’t\n",
      "   occur.\n",
      "• Let’s start by looking at an example of the problems the compiler \n",
      "faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "\fExample: memclr function\n",
      "\n",
      "• The memclr function clears N bytes of memory at address data.\n",
      "\n",
      "• No matter how advanced the compiler, it does not \n",
      "\n",
      "know whether N can be 0 on input or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Therefore the compiler needs to test for this case \n",
      "explicitly before the first iteration of the loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The compiler doesn’t know whether the data array \n",
      "\n",
      "•\n",
      "\n",
      "pointer is four-byte aligned or not.\n",
      "If it is four-byte aligned, then the compiler can clear \n",
      "four bytes at a time using an int store rather than a \n",
      "char store.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Nor does it know whether N is a multiple of four or \n",
      "\n",
      "not.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The compiler must be conservative and assume all \n",
      "\n",
      "possible values for N and all possible alignments for \n",
      "data.\n",
      "\n",
      "\fOvercoming problems faced by compilers\n",
      "\n",
      "•To write efficient C code, you must be aware of \n",
      "areas where the C compiler has to be \n",
      "conservative, the limits of the processor \n",
      "architecture the C compiler is mapping to, and \n",
      "the limits of a specific C compiler.\n",
      "•Most of this section covers the first two points \n",
      "above and should be applicable to any ARM C \n",

      "\fBasic C Data Types\n",
      "\n",
      "• Let’s start by looking at how ARM compilers handle the basic C data types.\n",
      "• There are also differences between the addressing modes available when \n",
      "\n",
      "loading and storing data of each type.\n",
      "\n",
      "• ARM processors have 32-bit registers and 32-bit data processing \n",
      "\n",
      "operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The ARM architecture is a RISC load/store architecture.\n",
      "• In other words you must load values from memory into registers before \n",
      "\n",
      "acting on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "• There are no arithmetic or logical instructions that manipulate values in \n",

      "memory directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\fLocal Variable Types\n",
      "\n",
      "• ARMv4-based processors can efficiently load and store 8-, 16-, and \n",
      "32-bit data.\n",
      "• However, most ARM data processing operations are 32-bit only.\n",
      "• For this reason, you should use a 32-bit datatype, int or long, for local \n",
      "variables wherever possible.\n",
      "• Avoid using char and short as local variable types, even if you are \n",
